	<h2>Better Together</h2>
	<p>Started more than 10 years ago, EPAAS has come a long way as a project and a viable community.
		Over the last year we kick started the EPAAS Foundation and the community
		is more growing and vibrant than ever.</p>

	<p>Working together ultimately makes us better. Life on earth evolved
		from single-cell organisms to multi-celled organisms when some
		cells started to specialise and co-operate with each other, increasing their
		chance of survival and growth. Similary the EPAAS community is now coming togther,
		where by specialization and co-operation,
		all of us become better.</p>
