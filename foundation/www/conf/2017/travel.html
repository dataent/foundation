	<p>A quick primer for those traveling to Mumbai.
	<p><b>Mumbai: </b>Mumbai is one of the biggest cities in the world with a population of more than 15 million. There are lots of places to visit from ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephanta_Caves">Buddhist caves</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India">British monuments</a> and plenty of Cafes and Bars.</p>
	<p><b>Hotels: </b>Hotels in Mumbai are generally expensive, so avoid staying very close to the venue. There are a lot of hotels around the airport and that might be the best option for getting a deal. The venue would be around 30-45 mins for the airport based on where you are. <a href='https://www.cleartrip.com/hotels/india/mumbai/'>Cleartrip</a> might have the best deals. <a href='https://www.airbnb.co.in/s/Mumbai--India'>AirBNB</a> might also have good options.</p>
	<p><b>Getting Around: </b><a href='https://www.uber.com/'>Uber</a> and <a href='https://www.olacabs.com/'>Ola Cabs</a> are app based taxi services that will work very well. We 100% recommend these over local taxis and auto-rickshaws (tuk-tuks) which are likely to over-charge out station passengers</p>
	<p><b>Venue: </b>The venue is at the <a href='https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Mysore+Association+Auditorium,+393,+Bhau+Daji+Road,+Matunga+East,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra+400019/@19.0284125,72.8549753,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3be7cf2892c6d671:0xd31576f646dcbc86'>Mysore Association Auditorium</a> and has all modern facilities you would expect from a venue. It is centrally located and easily accessible from all corners.</p>
