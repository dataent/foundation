# Getting Started with EPAAS

There are many ways to get started with EPAAS.

### 1\. See the Demo

If you want to check out the user interface and **feel** the application, just
see the demo at:

  * <https://demo.epaas.com>

### 2\. Start a Free Account at EPAAS.com


EPAAS.com is managed by the organization (Frappé) that publishes EPAAS.
You can start with your own account by [signing up on the
website](https://epaas.com).

You can also decide to host your application at epaas.com by buying the
hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and
improves EPAAS. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the
hosting plans.

### 3\. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, EPAAS is available as a
Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with EPAAS installed). You can
use this on **any** platform including Microsoft Windows.

[Click here to see instructions on how to use the Virtual
Image](https://epaas.com/download)

### 4\. Install EPAAS on your Unix/Linux/Mac machine

If you are familiar with installing applications on *nix platforms, read the instructions on how to install using [Frappé Bench](https://github.com/dataent/bench).
