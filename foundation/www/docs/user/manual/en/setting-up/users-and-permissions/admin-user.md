# Administrator User

If your EPAAS account is hosted with us (Dataent Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), then you won't be able to access your EPAAS account as an Administrator. For the hosted account, access via Administrator User us reserved with us.

1.  For the hosted account, upgrades are managed from the backend. We reserve admin login credential with us so that we can upgrade all the hosted customer's EPAAS accounts from the backend. 

2.  Since on a single server, we host have many customer's EPAAS accounts, as a security measure, we cannot share the credentials for administrator account with any hosted user.
