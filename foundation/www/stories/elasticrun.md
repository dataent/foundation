#### How did you discover EPAAS?

While searching for OpenSource ERP packages on Google.

#### Why did you choose to implement an ERP system?

Seemed very simple, neat and consistent UI in the beginning. As we deep dived, we found the framework underneath to be even better and the customisation options were very neatly modelled in the entire package.

#### Share some insights from your implementation process. How did you manage the change process?

We are using EPAAS for our in house business processes and accounting. We started off very small, with very basic features like Employee details, leave applications and expense claim. As our expertise and confidence in EPAAS grew we rolled out Supplier, Purchase, accounting modules also.

#### What modules did you end up using? And how?

HR, Buying, Accounting, Sales are the key modules are using right now. As stated above, we started off small with HR modules and gradually added workflows and transactions for other internal business processes.

Also, we are in the process of exploring Dataent framework as a rapid application development framework.

#### What are the best things about EPAAS?

1. The entire notion of DocType and everything built around/on-top of that.
2. Simplicity and genericity of key features which become seamlessly available.
3. Tooling framework of “bench” makes it extremely easy for admin activities.
4. Default implementation of EPAAS app contains a lot of out of the box workflows and logic which is very relevant and appropriate for any small/medium enterprise.

#### What were the key outcomes / benefits for your organization from implementing EPAAS

A single package to contain all our formal business process needs as well as to systemize adhoc and tactical needs/requirements as well with same ease.
