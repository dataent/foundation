#### How did you discover EPAAS?

We were looking for an open source ERP system and stumbled upon EPAAS in Google search.

#### Why did you choose to implement an ERP system?

With 1000+ employees, managing HR processes required a good system in place, found EPAAS fit for all our use cases and decided to implement it.

#### How did you manage the implementation process?

We worked with HR team to understand the existing processes and looked for the options present in EPAAS. Most of the options were available out of the box, so minimal configuration was required. The change process with users was smooth as users were able pick up the user interface with minimal training.


#### What modules did you end up using? And how?

We use Accounts and HR module. In HR, we use attendance, appraisals, employee records,  recruitment and expense claims. We use the accounting module for our customer ledgers and our IT asset management.

In the attendance module, data is imported from a biometric system every day. Employees get to see their attendance, leave balances and can also apply for leaves. All employee records are maintained in EPAAS. We use the recruitment module to maintain our job vacancy lists and process applicants.

#### What are the best things about EPAAS?

The beautiful user interface that comes out of the box is great as people are able to pick up intuitively. The ease of configuring all modules to suit our specific requirements is commendable. Dataent framework that powers EPAAS has also been utilised a lot by us to plug in various middlewares into EPAAS as well as build stand alone applications. For us, Dataent is the best thing about EPAAS.

#### What were the key outcomes / benefits for your organization from implementing EPAAS

The prominent benefit has been streamlining all our HR processes into a standard workflow. We are now able to rapidly build forms and applications required by the company's evolving business requirements. When a new form or feature is released, users are able to pick them without any training.

This has saved us a lot of time which would have been spent if we would have built something like this from scratch. This represents a significant boost in productivity.

We have also used dataent extensively to build several micro services internally. Dataent has streamlined the business development process for us and made the UI and UX consistent across our internal applications.
